# css_landing_page

I really developed a passion for CSS during building my recipe website, so I wanted to revisit some of the work I had done earlier in The Odin Project to build a landing page, and refine it a bit.

During the course of building, I decided to make it a generic news website so I could try a different style. This enabled me to also experiment with some basic animation and buttons.
